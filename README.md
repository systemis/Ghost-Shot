## Something about app: 
ExchangeInstargram (or ExchangePhoto) is a photo app for teen (or people over 15 year old). It work the simple same way as [Instargram](https://www.instagram.com/) (upload, comment, like, share) and have some special function on future. 

Althought it's a opensource project and for fun, it's not pet project. If it will be success in future, i will unlock it. Now, you can see it and learn way to code or support me for project.
